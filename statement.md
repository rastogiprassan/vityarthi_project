PROBLEM STATEMENNT:
The problem statement for a cab fare estimator typically is:

To design a system that predicts the fare amount for a cab ride based on factors such as the distance traveled, pickup location, and time. This system aims to provide accurate fare estimates to customers by using historical data of previous rides or predefined fare rates including base fare, per kilometer charges, and any additional charges like waiting time or surcharges.

In essence, the problem is to create a mathematical or algorithmic model that, given inputs like distance and timing, outputs the expected fare for a cab trip. This helps cab service providers to automate fare calculation and allows customers to estimate their trip cost upfront.

For example, a project might describe it as predicting the cab fare amount from input variables like distance, pickup coordinates, and time, minimizing the error between predicted and actual fare amounts.​

SCOPE OF THE PROJECT:
The scope of a cab fare estimator project generally includes the following key aspects:

1. Developing a system that accurately calculates cab fare based primarily on distance traveled, including additional parameters like base fare, waiting time, and surcharges.

2. Providing a tool for users to estimate trip costs upfront for better transparency and planning.

3. Enabling cab operators to optimize fare management and offer competitive pricing.

4. Incorporating features such as user input for distance or pickup and drop locations, and outputting the fare based on          predefined tariff rules or predictive models.

5. Potentially expanding to integrate real-time data inputs like traffic conditions and time of travel for more accurate dynamic fare calculations.

6. Designing the system to be user-friendly, scalable, and efficient for practical everyday usage.

This project can also serve as a foundation for more advanced applications including fare prediction using machine learning, real-time booking systems, and route optimization. The scope might be limited to distance-based fare calculation initially but could be expanded based on user requirements and data availability.​

TARGET USERS:
The target users for a cab fare estimator project include:

1. Passengers who want to estimate the cost of their taxi or cab rides before booking, helping them make informed decisions and budget travel expenses.

2. Tourists or visitors in unfamiliar locations who need fare estimates to avoid being overcharged or surprised by fares.

3. Taxi drivers and cab companies who want to provide transparent and accurate fare quotations to customers.

4. Ride-hailing app developers and operators who require fare calculation modules integrated into their platforms for dynamic pricing.

5. Transport planners and researchers analyzing fare structures and travel behavior.

6. These users benefit from a system that provides quick, reliable, and user-friendly fare estimates based on distance and other relevant parameters, ensuring fairness and convenience in taxi travel.​

HIGH LEVEL FEATURS:
High-level features of a cab fare estimator system typically include:

1. Distance-based fare calculation using predefined base fare and per-kilometer rates.

2. Interactive map integration (e.g., Mapbox) to select pickup and drop-off points and visualize routes.

3. Fare comparison across multiple service providers or vehicle types.

4. User authentication and profile management for secure access and personalized experience.

5. Trip history tracking for users to review past fare estimations and rides.

6. Dynamic fare adjustments based on real-time factors such as surge pricing or waiting time.

7. Visual analytics and charts to display fare trends and cost breakdown.

8. Backend APIs for fare calculation, user management, and trip data handling.

These features ensure a user-friendly, accurate, and transparent fare estimating tool for passengers and operators, with extensibility for advanced options like machine learning-based fare predictions.​
